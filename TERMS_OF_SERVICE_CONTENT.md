If you are using our Services on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms, and references to "you" include both you as an individual and the organization you represent.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and UpsurgeIQ. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, and such modifications will be effective upon posting to our website or notification to you via email. Your continued use of our Services after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.

**Account Security:** You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized access to or use of your account or any other security breach. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account credentials or from unauthorized access to your account that occurs through no fault of ours.

**Account Termination:** We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms, engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity, or posed a security risk to our Services or other users. Upon termination, your right to use our Services immediately ceases, and we may delete your account and associated data subject to our data retention policies and legal obligations.

## Third-Party Services and Integrations

## Disclaimer of Warranties

OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We do not warrant that our Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free from viruses or other harmful components. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content, information, or materials available through our Services, including AI-generated content. You acknowledge that AI-generated content may contain errors, inaccuracies, or inappropriate material, and you are responsible for reviewing and verifying all content before use or distribution.

We do not guarantee any specific results from using our Services, including media coverage, audience engagement, or business outcomes. Marketing and public relations results depend on numerous factors beyond our control, and past performance or case studies do not guarantee future results.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. In such cases, our warranties are limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UPSURGEIQ, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OUR SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID US ANY FEES.

These limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted by law and shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless UpsurgeIQ, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of our Services, your User Content, your violation of these Terms, your violation of any rights of another party, or your violation of any applicable laws or regulations.

We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in which case you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. This indemnification obligation will survive termination of these Terms and your use of our Services.

## Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction to be specified], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of our Services shall be resolved through the following process.

**Informal Resolution:** Before initiating any formal dispute resolution, you agree to contact us at legal@upsurgeiq.com to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve the dispute through good-faith negotiations for at least thirty (30) days before either party may initiate formal proceedings.

**Arbitration:** If informal resolution is unsuccessful, any dispute shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by [Arbitration Organization to be specified] in accordance with its rules, except as modified by these Terms. The arbitration shall be conducted in [Location to be specified], and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. You and UpsurgeIQ agree that arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class action, and you waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.

**Exceptions:** Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights or confidential information.

## General Provisions

**Entire Agreement:** These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other policies or agreements referenced herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and UpsurgeIQ regarding your use of our Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral.

**Severability:** If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, and the invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

**Waiver:** Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of UpsurgeIQ.

**Assignment:** You may not assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations hereunder without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms without restriction. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section is void.

**No Agency:** Nothing in these Terms creates any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship between you and UpsurgeIQ. You have no authority to bind UpsurgeIQ or make commitments on our behalf.

**Force Majeure:** We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, pandemics, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.

**Survival:** Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including but not limited to ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution provisions.
