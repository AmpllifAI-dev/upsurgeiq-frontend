# Quick Start Checklist

Use this checklist when deploying the framework on a new project.

---

## Initial Setup (2-4 hours)

### Project Initialization

- [ ] Create project folder structure
- [ ] Copy `AI_AGENT_START_HERE.md` template to project root
- [ ] Copy `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` template to project root
- [ ] Copy `WORKING_METHODOLOGY.md` template to project root
- [ ] Copy `CLIENT_PREFERENCES.md` template to project root
- [ ] Create `docs/` folder
- [ ] Create `docs/todo.md`
- [ ] Create `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md`
- [ ] Create `docs/COMMON_ISSUES.md`
- [ ] Create `docs/SESSION_NOTES.md`

### Content Creation

- [ ] Fill in `AI_AGENT_START_HERE.md` with project basics
- [ ] Complete `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with project overview
- [ ] Customize `WORKING_METHODOLOGY.md` for this project
- [ ] Conduct client discovery session
- [ ] Document client preferences in `CLIENT_PREFERENCES.md`
- [ ] Add initial tasks to `docs/todo.md`

---

## First Session with AI Agent

### Before Work Begins

- [ ] Tell AI agent to read `AI_AGENT_START_HERE.md`
- [ ] Wait for AI to load all context files
- [ ] Ask AI to confirm understanding
- [ ] Verify AI has correct priorities
- [ ] Begin work only after confirmation

### During Session

- [ ] Document decisions in `DECISIONS_LOG.md` as they're made
- [ ] Update `todo.md` as tasks progress
- [ ] Add solved problems to `COMMON_ISSUES.md`
- [ ] Maintain quality standards

### End of Session

- [ ] Ensure all documentation is updated
- [ ] Add session summary to `SESSION_NOTES.md`
- [ ] Update `AI_AGENT_START_HERE.md` with current status
- [ ] Verify next session can pick up easily

---

## Weekly Maintenance

- [ ] Review all context files for accuracy
- [ ] Update outdated information
- [ ] Archive completed tasks in `todo.md`
- [ ] Reflect on what's working/not working
- [ ] Make improvements to framework

---

## Monthly Health Check

- [ ] Is context loss still happening?
- [ ] Are AI agents getting up to speed quickly?
- [ ] Is documentation being maintained?
- [ ] What could be improved?
- [ ] Update templates based on learnings

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know the framework is working when:

- [ ] AI agents can start working within 10 minutes
- [ ] You rarely repeat the same information
- [ ] Work quality is consistent across sessions
- [ ] Decisions aren't being contradicted
- [ ] You feel confident handing off to new AI iterations

---

## Troubleshooting

**If AI agents aren't loading context:**
- Ensure `AI_AGENT_START_HERE.md` is in project root
- Explicitly tell them to read it
- Verify all linked files are accessible

**If documentation is getting stale:**
- Update during sessions, not at the end
- Schedule weekly reviews
- Make documentation part of "done"

**If overhead feels too high:**
- Focus on the essentials (Start Here, Decisions, Todo)
- Link to details rather than duplicating
- Remove documentation that isn't being used

---

**Remember: Start simple, enhance as needed. The framework should serve you, not burden you.**
