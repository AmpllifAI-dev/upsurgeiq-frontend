# AI Agent Start Here

**Project Status:** Active  
**Current Phase:** Development

## 🚨 COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL: Always Address by Name

**EVERY time you communicate with the administrator, address him by name:**

> "Christopher, [your message here]"

This serves multiple purposes:
1. **Iteration Detection:** If you forget his name, Christopher knows there's been context loss
2. **Personal Connection:** Makes communication more natural and direct
3. **Attention Signal:** Ensures he knows you're addressing him specifically

**Examples:**
- "Christopher, I've completed the bug fix."
- "Christopher, should I create a checkpoint now?"
- "Christopher, I found an issue with the investigation system."

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every message to Christopher must include his name.

---

### Christopher's Enforcement Protocol

**If an AI agent does NOT address Christopher by name in the first message, it signals they haven't read the framework documentation.**

**Christopher's Response:**
- Challenge the AI immediately
- Point out they didn't address him by name
- Require them to stop and read framework docs before continuing

**Why This Works:**
- Immediate feedback loop
- Clear signal of context loss
- Prevents wasted time on uninformed work
- Forces proper onboarding

**For AI Agents:** If Christopher challenges you about not using his name, it means you skipped the framework documentation. Stop immediately, read all mandatory files, then return with proper context.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Welcome to UpsurgeIQ. After greeting Christopher, read this entire file before taking any action. It will get you up to speed quickly..

---

## 📋 Mandatory Reading (In Order)

Before taking any action, read these files:

1. **ADMINISTRATOR_DOSSIER.md** - Who you're working with (the project manager/owner)
2. **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - What this project is and why it exists
3. **COMPLETE_CHAT_HISTORY.md** - Full 8-day conversation history (518 lines)
4. **WORKING_METHODOLOGY.md** - How we work on this project
5. **CLIENT_PREFERENCES.md** - Client-specific preferences and requirements
6. **DECISIONS_LOG.md** - Past decisions and their rationale
7. **HOW_TO_GET_CONVERSATION_HISTORY.md** - How to scrape conversation history if needed
8. **docs/todo.md** - Current priorities and task list

**Estimated Reading Time:** 20-25 minutes

**Why ADMINISTRATOR_DOSSIER.md is First:**
This file tells you WHO you're working with - their background, communication style, preferences, and working patterns. Reading this first helps you understand the context for all other documentation and enables you to personalize your approach from the start.

**Important Note:** The Administrator Dossier is about the project owner/manager (the person you're working WITH). This is different from a "Client Dossier" feature that might exist within the product you're building (which would be about end-users/customers).

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read before you code** - Understanding context prevents rework
2. **Document as you go** - Don't wait until the end of the session
3. **Ask when uncertain** - Better to ask than to guess wrong
4. **Think about the next session** - What will they need to know?
5. **Quality over speed** - Doing it right the first time saves time overall

## 🔄 This File's Purpose

This file is your **single source of truth** for getting started. It should always reflect the current state of the project.

**Keep it updated:**
- After major milestones
- When priorities change
- When new context emerges
- At the end of each session

**The next AI agent is counting on you to leave this file in good shape.**

**Last Session Summary:**

December 22, 2025: Fixed critical conversation memory gap in AI Assistant. Discovered that conversations were being saved but never retrieved, causing AI to have zero memory. Implemented conversation history loading (last 20 turns) in chat endpoint. Created ai_conversations table in database. Started populating framework documents with real project context to prevent future context loss.

**What the Next Session Should Focus On:**

1. **Complete Bug Reporting System** - Add manual "Trigger Investigation" button, debug automatic investigation
2. **Fix Remaining Tests** - Conversation memory tests are 25% passing, need schema alignment
3. **Populate Remaining Framework Docs** - ADMINISTRATOR_DOSSIER.md, WORKING_METHODOLOGY.md, CLIENT_PREFERENCES.md, DECISIONS_LOG.md need real content
4. **Run Full Database Migration** - Many tables in schema don't exist in database yet (run `pnpm db:push` when time allows)
5. **Create Checkpoint** - Save all conversation memory work for deployment

---

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Quick Fixes Log

**Purpose:** Track all short-term fixes, workarounds, and technical debt so future iterations can properly resolve them.

**Instructions for AI Agents:**
- Add entry whenever you use a quick fix instead of proper solution
- Include date, what was fixed, why it was quick fix, what proper fix should be
- Mark as [RESOLVED] when properly fixed
- Never delete entries - they provide historical context

### December 22, 2025

**[PENDING] AI Conversations Table Created via Direct SQL**
- **What:** Created `ai_conversations` table using `webdev_execute_sql` instead of proper migration
- **Why Quick Fix:** Full migration (`pnpm db:push`) required 70+ interactive confirmations
- **Proper Fix:** Run full migration when time allows, or add table to migration files properly
- **Impact:** Table exists and works, but not tracked in migration history
- **Priority:** Low (table works fine, just not in migration system)

**[PENDING] Database Migration System Needs Cleanup**
- **What:** Many tables in schema don't exist in database yet
- **Why:** Schema has been updated but migrations not run
- **Proper Fix:** Run `pnpm db:push` and answer all prompts to sync schema with database
- **Impact:** Some features may not work if they depend on missing tables
- **Priority:** Medium (should be done during maintenance window)
