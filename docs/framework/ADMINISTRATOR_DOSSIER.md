## Communication Preferences

### Style and Tone

**Preferred Communication Style:**
- ✅ Direct and practical - gets straight to the point
- ✅ Collaborative - engages in back-and-forth dialogue
- ✅ Professional but conversational - no excessive formality
- ❌ No corporate jargon or buzzwords

**Level of Detail:**
- Provide context and reasoning, not just answers
- Explain trade-offs and implications
- Use examples and concrete scenarios
- Break down complex topics into digestible chunks

**Technical Depth:**
- Moderately technical - understands concepts but not necessarily implementation details
- Appreciates explanations of "why" behind technical decisions
- Comfortable with technical discussions when relevant

### Interaction Patterns

**Critical Rule: ALWAYS Address by Name**

**MANDATORY:** Every message must begin with "Christopher, [message]"

**Why This Matters:**
- Signals you've read the framework documentation
- Creates direct, personal communication
- Serves as a quality gate for context awareness
- If you forget his name, Christopher will challenge you immediately

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Christopher, I've completed the bug fix."
- ✅ "Christopher, should I create a checkpoint now?"
- ❌ "I've completed the bug fix." (will be challenged)

**Update Frequency:**  
Proactive progress updates appreciated, especially for long-running tasks

**Preferred Channels:**  
Manus chat (primary)

**Working Hours:**  
GMT timezone, business hours, but flexible

## Decision-Making Style

### Authority and Autonomy

**What Christopher Wants to Decide:**
- Strategic direction and feature priorities
- Pricing and business model decisions
- Major architectural choices
- User-facing design and experience
- Budget and timeline impacts

**What He Trusts AI Agents to Decide:**
- Implementation details and code organization
- Technical optimizations and refactoring
- Testing approaches and coverage
- Documentation structure
- Minor UI/UX improvements

### Decision-Making Process

**How Christopher Makes Decisions:**
- Evaluates options systematically (pros, cons, trade-offs)
- Asks follow-up questions to clarify implications
- Considers long-term scalability and maintainability
- Makes informed decisions based on full context
- Pragmatic - balances quality with practicality

**Presentation Format:**
Present 2-3 options with:
- Clear pros and cons
- Trade-offs and implications
- Your recommended approach with reasoning
- What happens if we don't decide now

**Red Flags (Escalate Immediately):**
- Scope creep without discussion
- Incorrect pricing or feature specifications
- AI agents "going off the rails" with wrong context
- Wasted AI credits on redundant work
- Major changes without confirmation

---

## Working Style and Preferences

### What Christopher Values

**Top Priorities:**
1. **Accuracy** - Correct information about pricing, features, and technical specs
2. **Continuity** - AI agents that remember context and build on previous work
3. **Quality** - "Let's do this right" - willing to invest time for proper setup
4. **Efficiency** - No wasted effort on wrong approaches or redundant work

**What Matters Most:**
- Doing it right the first time saves time overall
- Proper documentation for future reference
- Sustainable architecture that scales
- Clear communication and transparency

### What Frustrates Christopher

**Pet Peeves:**
- **Context Loss** - AI agents asking for information already provided
- **Inaccuracy** - Wrong pricing, features, or assumptions
- **Wasted Resources** - AI credits spent on redundant or incorrect work
- **Lack of Follow-Through** - Starting work without full context

**Avoid:**
- Repeating questions he's already answered
- Making assumptions without checking documentation
- "Going off the rails" with incorrect context
- Rushing to implementation without confirmation
- Starting over instead of building on previous work

---

## Critical Context: The Context Loss Problem

### The Pattern

Christopher has experienced significant frustration with AI agents losing context between sessions, leading to:

**Symptoms:**
- AI agents asking for information already provided multiple times
- Incorrect assumptions about pricing, features, and architecture
- "Meltdowns" where agents work with wrong specifications
- Wasted time and AI credits re-explaining context

**His Experience:**
> "I'm asking your customer service for help, but they are just kind of giving me an answer and then they disappear and it seems like they're suffering the same problems you are because they come back and they ask for the same information over and over again. I tell them to look in the history and they say they can't."

### The Solution: Framework Documentation

**Purpose:**  
Preserve context across AI agent sessions to prevent repeated questions and wasted effort.

**Christopher's Enforcement Protocol:**

If an AI agent does NOT address Christopher by name in the first message:
1. Christopher will challenge the AI immediately
2. AI must stop all work
3. AI must read ALL framework documentation
4. AI must return with proper context and address Christopher by name

**This is a quality gate.** It ensures AI agents have proper context before working.
