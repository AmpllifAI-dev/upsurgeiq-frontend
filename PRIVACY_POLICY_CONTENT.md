This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and processing when you use our AI-powered PR and marketing platform, including our website, services, and applications (collectively, the "Services").

By accessing or using our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices, please do not use our Services.

## Information We Collect

We collect several types of information to provide, maintain, and improve our Services, as well as to protect our users and comply with legal obligations.

**Information You Provide Directly:** When you create an account, subscribe to our services, or interact with our platform, you provide information including your name, email address, company name, website URL, payment information, and any content you create or upload such as press releases, social media posts, journalist lists, or campaign materials. You may also provide optional information such as your phone number, job title, industry sector, and marketing preferences to enhance your experience.

**Automatically Collected Information:** When you access our Services, we automatically collect certain technical information including your IP address, browser type and version, device identifiers, operating system, referring URLs, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and general location information derived from your IP address. We use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to collect this information and improve your experience.

**Information from Third Parties:** We may receive information about you from third-party services you connect to our platform, such as social media accounts, authentication providers (including Manus OAuth, LinkedIn, and Facebook), payment processors, or analytics services. When you authorize these integrations, we collect information necessary to provide the requested functionality, such as profile information, contact lists, or posting permissions.

**Usage and Performance Data:** We collect information about how you use our Services, including features accessed, campaigns created, press releases generated, distribution channels used, engagement metrics, and performance analytics. This data helps us understand user behavior, improve our platform, and provide personalized recommendations.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for several legitimate business purposes that enable us to deliver and improve our Services.

**Service Delivery and Functionality:** We use your information to create and manage your account, process transactions and subscriptions, generate AI-powered content including press releases and social media posts, distribute your content across selected channels, provide customer support and respond to inquiries, send transactional communications about your account or services, and deliver the core functionality of our platform.

**Platform Improvement and Personalization:** We analyze usage patterns to improve our Services, develop new features, personalize your experience based on your preferences and behavior, provide relevant recommendations and insights, optimize our AI models and algorithms, and conduct research and analytics to enhance platform performance.

**Communication and Marketing:** With your consent where required, we send you marketing communications about new features, product updates, industry insights, and promotional offers. We also communicate important service announcements, security alerts, and policy changes. You may opt out of marketing communications at any time while continuing to receive essential service-related messages.

**Security and Fraud Prevention:** We use your information to detect, prevent, and respond to security incidents, fraud, abuse, or illegal activities; verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access; monitor and analyze security threats; enforce our Terms of Service and other policies; and protect the rights, property, and safety of UpsurgeIQ, our users, and the public.

**Legal Compliance:** We process your information to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes; respond to lawful requests from public authorities; establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; and fulfill our contractual obligations.

## How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We share your information only in specific circumstances necessary to provide our Services or as required by law.

**Service Providers and Business Partners:** We engage trusted third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf, including cloud hosting and infrastructure providers, payment processors, email delivery services, analytics platforms, customer support tools, and AI model providers. These providers access your information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated to protect your information and use it only for authorized purposes.

**Content Distribution:** When you use our Services to distribute press releases, social media posts, or other content, we share that content with the channels, publications, journalists, or platforms you select. This distribution is the core purpose of our Services and occurs according to your explicit instructions.

**Business Transfers:** If UpsurgeIQ is involved in a merger, acquisition, asset sale, or bankruptcy proceeding, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

**Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose information when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

**Aggregated and Anonymized Data:** We may share aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. This may include industry benchmarks, usage statistics, or research findings that help improve our Services and contribute to industry knowledge.

## Data Security and Retention

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

**Security Measures:** Our security practices include encryption of data in transit using TLS/SSL protocols and encryption of sensitive data at rest; secure authentication mechanisms including password hashing and multi-factor authentication support; regular security assessments and vulnerability testing; access controls limiting employee access to personal information on a need-to-know basis; monitoring and logging of system access and activities; and incident response procedures to address potential security breaches.

**Data Retention:** We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide our Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When you close your account, we delete or anonymize your personal information within a reasonable timeframe, except where we must retain certain information to comply with legal requirements, prevent fraud, or resolve disputes. Backup copies may persist in our systems for a limited period before permanent deletion.

**Your Responsibility:** While we implement robust security measures, you also play a role in protecting your information. Use strong, unique passwords for your account; enable multi-factor authentication when available; do not share your account credentials; log out of your account when using shared devices; and promptly notify us of any unauthorized access or security concerns.

## Your Privacy Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. We respect these rights and provide mechanisms to exercise them.

**Access and Portability:** You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you and request a copy in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. You can export your data through your account settings or by contacting us.

**Correction and Update:** You can update your account information, preferences, and settings directly through our platform. If you identify inaccurate or incomplete information that you cannot correct yourself, contact us for assistance.

**Deletion:** You may request deletion of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions where we must retain information to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, or enforce our agreements. You can delete your account through your account settings or by contacting us.

**Objection and Restriction:** You may object to certain processing of your personal information or request that we restrict processing in specific circumstances, such as while we verify the accuracy of your information or assess whether we have legitimate grounds to continue processing.

**Marketing Communications:** You can opt out of marketing emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any marketing message or by updating your communication preferences in your account settings. Even if you opt out of marketing communications, we will continue to send you essential service-related messages.

**Cookies and Tracking:** You can control cookies through your browser settings and opt out of certain analytics and advertising cookies through industry opt-out mechanisms. Note that disabling certain cookies may affect the functionality of our Services.

**Do Not Sell My Personal Information:** We do not sell personal information as defined by applicable privacy laws. If you have concerns about how we share your information, please review the "How We Share Your Information" section above or contact us.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@upsurgeiq.com. We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by applicable law, typically within 30 days.

## International Data Transfers

UpsurgeIQ operates globally and may transfer your personal information to countries other than where you reside. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your jurisdiction.

When we transfer personal information internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards to protect your information, including standard contractual clauses approved by relevant authorities, adequacy decisions recognizing equivalent data protection standards, and other legally recognized transfer mechanisms. We ensure that any third parties processing your information internationally provide adequate protection consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.

## Children's Privacy

Our Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without appropriate parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.

## Third-Party Links and Services

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites, applications, or services that are not operated by UpsurgeIQ. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party services, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you access through our platform.

When you connect third-party accounts or services to our platform (such as social media accounts or authentication providers), those services may collect information about you according to their own privacy policies. We receive only the information necessary to provide the requested integration functionality.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or business operations. When we make material changes, we will notify you by email (if you have provided an email address) or by posting a prominent notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. Your continued use of our Services after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
